            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I am a Full-Stack Engineer, who resently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. Prior to beginning my path in engineering, I have worked as a technicain accross multiple industries, with a focus on troubleshooting electronics and low votage systems. Most recently, I am employeed by Convergint Technologies as a Lead Project Specialist, installing and maintaining IP video, card access, and intrusion detection systems for high security facilities. Since learning software development, I have been able to find success by applying my troubleshooting skills, and forward-thinking methodologies to every piece of code I write.

                For working as long as I have in the security technology field, I am not surprised to find that I have a passion for working with large amounts of data, and moving it to were it needs to go. And thanks to being trained as a full-stack engineer, I am equally able to take that data and represent it in a meaningfull way to the end user. A quick browse through my major projects should demonstrate my passion in this.

                Aside from my new found passion for coding, I also enjoy music (both listening and playing), hiking, video games(though I rarely make the time for them these days), reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.

                As a Software Engineer, I have been able to use my vast troubleshooting experience to overcome problems as they arise. These skills allow me to adapt to technical limitations of systems and changing requirements of clients. I believe every problem has a solutionâ€“sometimes the key is creativity.
